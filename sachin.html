                    <dd >On 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987–88 season, but he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, 
                        though he was often used as a substitute field. A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium
                         and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket. He was selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar 
                         after Vengsarkar watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's cricket practice nets, where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments</dd>

              <dd>Tendulkar opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.He competed in 78 ODIs before scoring his first century.

                  Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.
                 After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out,
                  Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether  Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over.[89] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.</dl>
                 <dt><b><ins>2011 Cricket World Cup and after </ins></b></dt>
                 <dd> India at the Cricket World Cup India at the 2011 World Cup From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries,
                     Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament, and was named in the ICC "Team of the Tournament". India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.
                      Shortly after the victory, India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England.
                       Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However,
                        his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.r
                        The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed. Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket,
                         during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.For his performances in 2011, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.
                         <b>Tendulkar commented that "Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy."</b></dd>
