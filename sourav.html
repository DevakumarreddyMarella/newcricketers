                    <dt><b><ins>1990–96: Career beginning and debut success</ins></b></dt>
                    <dd >In 1990–91,[31] Ganguly scored three runs in his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against the West Indies in 1992.[18][32] He was dropped immediately since he was perceived to be "arrogant"
                         and his attitude towards the game was openly questioned. It was rumoured that Ganguly refused to carry drinks for his teammates, commenting that it was not his job to do so, later denied by him. Consequently,
                          he was removed from the team.[22][27] He toiled away in domestic cricket, scoring heavily in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 Ranji seasons. Following an innings of 171 in the 1995–96 Duleep Trophy, he was recalled
                           to the Indian team for a tour of England in 1996, in the middle of intense media scrutiny. He played in a single ODI, but was omitted from the team for the first Test. However, after teammate Navjot Singh
                            Sidhu left the touring party, citing ill-treatment by then captain Mohammad Azharuddin.Ganguly made his Test debut against England in the Second Test of a three-match series at Lord's Cricket Ground along
                             with Rahul Dravid.England had won the First Test of the three-match series; however, Ganguly scored a century, becoming only the third cricketer to achieve such a feat on debut at Lord's, after Harry Graham and John Hampshire.
                              Andrew Strauss and Matt Prior have since accomplished this feat, but Ganguly's 131 still remains the highest by any batsman on his debut at the ground.</dd>
              <dt><b><ins>2000–05: Ascension to captaincy and accolades</ins></b></dt>
              <dd>In 2000, after the match fixing scandal by some of the players of the team,[52] Ganguly was named the captain of the Indian cricket team. The decision was spurred due to Tendulkar stepping down from the position for his health,
                 and Ganguly being the vice-captain at that time.[22] He began well as a captain, leading India to a series win over South Africa in the five-match one day series and led the Indian team to the finals of the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy
                 .He scored two centuries, including one in the final; however, New Zealand still won by four wickets. The same year, Ganguly tried his hand at county cricket career in England but was not successful. In "The Wisden Cricketer",
                  reviewers Steve Pittard and John Stern called him as "The imperious Indian—dubbed 'Lord Snooty'". </dd>
                 <dt><b><ins>2008–12: International retirement and IPL</ins></b></dt>
                 <dd>n February 2008, Ganguly joined as the captain of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team, owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, as part of the Indian Premier League (IPL).[101] On 18 April 2008, Ganguly led the KKR, in the IPL Twenty20 cricket match.
                     They had a 140 run victory over Bangalore Royal Challengers (captained by Rahul Dravid and owned by Vijay Mallya). Ganguly opened the innings with Brendan McCullum and scored 10 runs while McCullum remained unbeaten, 
                     scoring 158 runs in 73 balls. On 1 May, in a game between the Knight Riders and the Rajasthan Royals, Ganguly made his second T20 half century, scoring 51 runs off of 39 balls at a strike rate of 130.76. In his innings, 
                     Ganguly hit four 4s and two sixes, topping the scorers list for the Knight Riders.</dd>
