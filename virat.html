            <p><b>Virat Kohli</b> born 5 November 1988 is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays as a right-handed 
                batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[4] Kohli holds the records for scoring most runs in T20 internationals 
                and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to a number of India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.</p>
            <p>He has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as the ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and has won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two 
                occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year. Additionally, he was named 
                the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Khel Ratna award,

                    <dd >In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour,
                         Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt. So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour,
                          as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.
                          On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.
                           However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.</dd>
              <dt><b><ins>2010–2011: Rise through the ranks</ins></b></dt>
              <dd>in January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was rested for the event. During the series, Kohli became
                 just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22. He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series,
                  with 275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66. Kohli's success on the field belies the stereotype of him as a brash and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain
                   MS Dhoni has noted that "he has grabbed his chances" and that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come across different to the world."</dd>
                 <dt><b><ins>Setting records and post-Tendulkar era </ins></b></dt>
                 <dd>Kohli stood in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies after Dhoni injured himself during the match; he named the captain for the remaining matches.
                    In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his first century as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India. Many senior players
                     including Dhoni were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013. Kohli was therefore appointed as captain for an entire series .In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls,
                      helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award.India completed a sweep of the series; their first in an away ODI.</dd>
